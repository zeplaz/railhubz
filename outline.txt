to do:
finsh railhub data struc for Trains sotrage
this is a binary serch tree.

fix the registy_maps stuff.
keys for

finish path maping.. who does what? were is wha tit needs?
add a pointer to railhubs taken by lines aready takes it but only keeps
a vector store pointer instead acess vecotr when need.



railhubz are an indepent object. they do not trust or use the msg service
simulate secutry or indepent system. they have their own structer of storege
this would be tipical of a real train station the train phisicly is taking up
space in a hub thta is not just a empty refs.


hold:

a id
time creation
a vector of pointers to R_linez connected to it.// this needs ot be apointer to a vector
as the whole thing needs to be accsable by the Cmd_agent_operator

binary serch tree for trainstorage,

a sfml vectorfloat {used for gui pcement as well as calculations of location for trains}
a sfml shapeobject for the gui.

//interface

constructor takes time, a sf vectorfloat and ref to total hubs in existnace.

geter for location returns sfvecfloat

add a train to the bts_ que.
remove a train from bts_que
find highest priorty train form bts que.




list_linez returns a pointer to the vector of linepointers.
